#Python_Project
Introduction:-
This project involves analyzing a dataset provided by ABC Company containing 458 rows and 9 columns. The dataset represents employee information across various teams within the organization. The goal of this project is to preprocess the dataset, perform analytical tasks, visualize findings graphically, and provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

Preprocessing Steps
Height Column Correction:
The height column in the dataset was corrected by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency and integrity.
Tools Used: Python's numpy library to generate random values.
General Data Cleaning:
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Renamed column headers (if necessary) to standardize the format for ease of analysis.

Analysis Tasks:
1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams:-
Calculated the total number of employees in each team.
Computed the percentage split of employees relative to the total employee count.
Visualization:
Bar chart showing the number of employees per team with annotations for exact values.

3. Employee Segregation by Position
Segregated employees based on their roles or positions within the company.
Tabulated the count of employees for each position.
Visualization:
 Horizontal Bar chart representing the count of employees in each position.

3. Predominant Age Group
Grouped employees into predefined age categories (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, etc.).
Identified the most common age group among employees.
Visualization:
Area chart highlighting the frequency of employees in each age group.

5. Highest Salary Expenditure by Team and Position
Calculated the total salary expenditure for each team and each position.
Identified the team and position with the highest overall salary expenditure.
Visualization:
 Bar chart to show salary expenditures across teams and positions.

5. Correlation Between Age and Salary
Computed the correlation coefficient between age and salary to assess the relationship.
Visualization:
Correlation heatmap for an overview of all numerical relationships.
Correlation matrix illustrating the relationship between age and salary.

Graphical Representations:-

Bar Chart: To visualize employee distribution across teams.

Horizontal Bar Charts: For employee segregation by position and salary expenditures.

Area Chart: To highlight the predominant age group.

Correlation Heatmap: To show the relationship between age and salary.

Correlation martix: To visually examine the correlation between age and salary.


Conclusion:-
This project provided a comprehensive analysis of ABC Company's employee dataset, offering actionable insights through effective preprocessing, thorough analysis, and clear visualizations. The findings highlight workforce trends, salary distribution, and potential correlations that can inform decision-making within the organization.
